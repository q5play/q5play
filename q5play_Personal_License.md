# q5play Personal License

This License Agreement ("Agreement") is made between Quinton Ashley, the sole copyright owner of q5play ("Licensor") and an individual, organization, or company ("Licensee") that is using q5play for free.

**_For commercial game development, see the [q5play Professional License](https://q5play.org/pro)._**

**_For educational use, see the [q5play Educational License](https://q5play.org/teach)._**

## 1. License Grant

The Licensee is granted the right to use the q5play software library ("Content") for personal use, subject to the following restrictions.

### 1a. Open Source Only

Any shared work that uses the Content must be open source. Source code needs to be:

- Human readable, not minified or obfuscated, but in the preferred form for making modifications
- Publicly available for free, not behind an account signup or paywall.

Any shared work that uses the Content must have its application source code made publicly available for free under one of the following licenses: AGPL, GPL, CC BY-SA, CC BY, ISC, or CC0.

The Licensee must also include a copy of this license alongside the Content.

These requirements apply to the entirety of work that uses the Content, not just q5play-related sections. It is the Licensee's responsibility to ensure that they understand the consequences of licensing their work as open source.

The Licensee is permitted to distribute their programs in a compiled or minified form only if the source code is made available as a prominent option alongside it.

If the Content is used within a web server or client-side web application ("the Application"), the open-source requirement applies strictly and only to the Licensee's source code for that Application. This requirement does not extend to third-party hosting platforms (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel), underlying operating systems, or third-party infrastructure used to serve the Application. However, if the Application merely hosts user-generated content that utilizes q5play, only the end-user is required to make their specific content open source.

The Licensee is also permitted to use the Content privately in projects that are not made available to others. Yet, public or limited distribution of closed source projects using the Content is prohibited.

### 1b. Limited Redistribution

The Licensee may host verbatim, unmodified copies of the Content only. "Verbatim copies" means exact duplicates of the Content as provided by the Licensor, without changes. The Licensee may not sell or sublicense the Content.

### 1c. Derivative Work Restrictions

Modification, enhancement, or adaptation of the Content ("Derivative Work") can be done privately for personal use, but any Derivative Work that is shared with others must be shared under the same terms as the original Content.

Derivative Works must be created for the sole purpose of improving the Content, for the benefit of all users of q5play.

### 1d. No Commercial Use

The Licensee is expressly forbidden from using the Content for commercial purposes.

- use must not involve an exchange of money
- use must not promote a business entity, including non-profit organizations
- use must not directly or indirectly result in financial gain

The Licensee must create an account on q5play.org and agree to the [q5play Professional License](https://q5play.org/pro) to use the Content commercially.

### 1e. Educational Use Limitation

Under fair use, the Licensee may produce educational content, such as YouTube tutorials, that explains and showcases use of the Content in a fixed media format, which does not enable direct interaction with the Content.

The Content may be used to create interactive educational media (e.g., teaching math, cooking, or history), provided the subject matter does not teach computer programming, game development, or the use of q5play itself. In cases of ambiguity regarding subject matter, the Licensor reserves the right to determine if the use is covered by this license.

Educational Use of the Content, such as in class instruction or coursework in which the Content is used directly by teachers or students, is prohibited under this Agreement. It requires the [q5play Educational License](https://q5play.org/teach), even if the Content is used indirectly through a third-party provider.

### 1f. No Military Use

The Licensee is expressly forbidden from using the Content in projects that are directly endorsed by military organizations, arms manufacturers, or military contractors.

### 1g. Attribution Required

The Licensee must publicly display appropriate credit to the Licensor for the Content, but not in any way that suggests the Licensor endorses the Licensee or the Licensee's use, unless the Licensor has given prior written consent.

Use of the "made with q5play" Loading Screen is required for all published work that uses q5play, unless the work is published on an online code editing platform or other web app that was approved by the Licensor to be exempt from this requirement, in which case the loading screen will not appear. Attribution can then be made at the top of the primary script file or in a README file. The following is an example of acceptable attribution:

```js
/**
 * Made with q5play!
 * https://q5play.org
 */
```

## 2. Licensee Eligibility

Any individual, organization, or company that is not paying licensing fees for their use of q5play is required to comply with this Agreement. Use of q5play constitutes acceptance of this Agreement.

## 3. "Learn q5play" Interactive Textbook Access

The Licensee is also granted access to the ["Learn q5play"](https://q5play.org/learn) interactive textbook located at q5play.org/learn, for personal learning and evaluation only, in compliance with the [q5play.org Terms of Service](https://q5play.org/account/tos.md).

## 4. No Warranty

The Content is provided "as is." The Licensor makes no warranties, express or implied, including without limitation any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, concerning the Content.

If the Licensee has any issues with the Content, they must contact the Licensor.

If the Licensee is not satisfied with the Content, it is their responsibility to discontinue use of the Content.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

The Licensor shall not be liable for any damages suffered by the Licensee resulting from the use or inability to use the Content.

Licensees must comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using q5play. It is illegal to create content that infringes on the rights of others. Licensees are fully liable for any content they create with q5play.

## 6. Termination

Termination of the Agreement will occur if the Licensee fails to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement. Therefore, termination can occur automatically, without notice from the Licensor.

## 7. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
